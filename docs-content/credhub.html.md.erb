CredHub is a secure credential management component that runs on the BOSH VM to minimize the surface area where credentials can be compromised.
This topic provides resources for configuring service tiles to use CredHub, instead of encoding credentials in product template and job template files.

See the [PCF CredHub documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/credhub/index.html) for more information.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

In Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v1.11.0, CredHub runs on the BOSH VM, alongside the BOSH Director and UAA. Ops Manager v1.11 stores its credentials in CredHub,
and users retrieve them using the CredHub API rather than from the **Credentials** tab of the Ops Manager Director tile.
Tile developers can embed CredHub calls in [manifest snippets](#snippets) and PCF apps can retrieve credentials using the CredHub API.

See [Fetching Variable Names and Values](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/credhub/credhub-api-variables.html)
in the PCF CredHub documentation for how to fetch variable names and values using the CredHub API.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: CredHub in PCF v1.11.0 does not support backup and restore, so Pivotal only recommends using CredHub for credentials that you can recover from elsewhere after a disaster.</p>

## <a id="types"></a> CredHub Credential Types

CredHub stores and retrieves the following types of credentials:

* `value` — single string value
* `json` — arbitrary JSON object
* `password` — password string
* `certificate` — object containing certificate authority (CA), certificate, and private key
* `ssh` — object containing SSH public key and private key
* `rsa` — object containing RSA public key and private key

## <a id="snippets"></a> CredHub in Manifest Snippets

Tile developers can embed CredHub in product template and job template manifest snippets using
[triple-parenthesis notation](./product-template-reference.html#job-manifest):

```
    manifest: |
      credhub:
        concatenated_password: prefix-((( credhub-password )))-suffix
        password: ((( credhub-password )))

```

## <a id="limitations"></a> PCF v1.11.0 Limitations

PCF v1.11.0 supports CredHub for credential storage, but it does not support the following:

* Automatic backup and restore for CredHub, along with other PCF system components.

* Automatic tile [upgrades](./tile-upgrades.html) that migrate all types of credentials defined in [property blueprints](./property-reference.html#property-blueprints) in previous tile versions, to storage in CredHub.

* Using CredHub to generate new credentials.

Tile authors may choose to wait until PCF supports some or all of these features before incorporating CredHub into their service.
