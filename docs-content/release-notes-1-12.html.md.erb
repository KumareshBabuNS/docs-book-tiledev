title: PCF v1.12 Partners Release Notice

This topic describes the changes that Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v1.12 introduces which may be relevant to partner service tiles.

## <a id="cred-types"></a>Additional Credential Migrations

Version 1.11.0 of PCF introduced CredHub for credential management, and PCF v1.11.1 added
support for migrating `secret` credentials to CredHub.

Ops Manager v1.12 added support for migrating additional credential types, including `rsa_pkey_credential` and `simple_credential`
types in the v1.12 Alpha release and `salted_credential` in the v1.12 Beta release.
Tile developers can migrate these credential types using the same JavaScript migration process as `secret` credentials.

<p class="note"><strong>Breaking Change</strong>: When migrating <code>salted_credentials</code>, CredHub does not retain the salt. If your tile depends on the salt,
refactor before migrating to CredHub.</p>

See [Migrating Existing Credentials to CredHub](./migrating-credhub-credentials.html) for more information.

## <a id="boolean-constants"></a>Ternary Operator Evaluates Boolean Constants

Ops Manager v1.12 adds support for evaluating boolean constants using ternary operators.
Previously, the ternary operator supported string constants, property references, or `named_manifest` declarations.

<p class="note"><strong>Breaking Change</strong>: If you define <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong> in any <code>property_blueprint</code> names, as shown in the workaround below, update your job manifest to use boolean constants.</p>

In previous versions of Ops Manager, to expose a property to operators as a checkbox that is checked by default,
a Tile Author defined the true and false properties in the job manifest as a workaround.
In the following example, the `disable_security_protocols` job spec property takes a boolean value:

```
property_blueprints:
- name: true
  type: boolean
  configurable: false
  default: true
- name: false
  type: boolean
  configurable: false
  default: false

manifest:
  disable_security_protocols: '(( .properties.secure_the_system ? .properties.false : .properties.true ))
```

In Ops Manager v1.12, the ternary operator manages boolean values natively.
A Tile Author can rewrite the above example using the following syntax:

```
disable_security_protocols: '(( .properties.secure_the_system ? false : true ))'
```

When using this syntax, enclose everything following the initial colon with either single or double
quotation marks and include the space between the boolean expression and the question mark, as shown above.

## <a id="zero-instance"></a>Resource Config Pane Hides Zero-Instance Jobs

A service tile's [**Resource Config**](./tile-structure.html#process) pane lists the jobs that the service runs and lets operators allocate resources to the jobs that are configurable.

Tiles can define a job as `non_configurable` and set its instance count to `0`. This prevents the job from running, but lets external services access the job properties. The Ops Manager 1.12 **Resource Config** pane and [API endpoints](https://opsman-dev-api-docs.cfapps.io/#retrieving-resource-configuration-for-a-product) do not include these zero-instance jobs.
