### <a id="cred-types"></a>Additional Credential Migrations

Version 1.11.0 of PCF introduced CredHub for credential management, and PCF v1.11.1 added
support for migrating `secret` credentials to CredHub.

PCF v1.12 Alpha 1 introduced support for migrating additional credential types, including `rsa` and `simple_credential`. Tile developers can migrate these credential types using the same JavaScript migration process as `secret` credentials.

See [Migrating Existing Credentials to CredHub](./migrating-credhub-credentials.html) for more information.
