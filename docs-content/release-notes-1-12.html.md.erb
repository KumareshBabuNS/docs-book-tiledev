This topic describes the changes that PCF v1.12 introduces which may be relevant to partner service tiles.

## <a id="credhub"></a>CredHub

### <a id="cred-types"></a>Additional Credential Migrations

Version 1.11.0 of PCF introduced CredHub for credential management, and PCF v1.11.1 added
support for migrating `secret` credentials to CredHub.

PCF v1.12 Alpha 1 introduced support for migrating additional credential types, including `rsa` and `simple_credential`. Tile developers can migrate these credential types using the same JavaScript migration process as `secret` credentials.

See [Migrating Existing Credentials to CredHub](./migrating-credhub-credentials.html) for more information.

## <a id="opsman"></a>Resource Config Pane Hides Zero-Instance Jobs

A service tile's [**Resource Config**](./tile-structure.html#process) pane lists the jobs that the service runs and lets operators allocate resources to the jobs that are configurable.

Tiles can define a job as `non_configurable` and set its instance count to `0`. This prevents the job from running, but lets external services access the job properties. The Ops Manager 1.12 **Resource Config** pane does not show these zero-instance jobs.
